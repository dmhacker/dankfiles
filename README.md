# dankfiles

This directory contains configuration files for my main workstation. I'm running Arch Linux on a Surface Book 2.

Some of the packages are Arch-specific, but there are probably other variants/ways to acquire them if you are using a different distribution. I also followed [this guide](https://reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/5r5ep8/make_your_arch_fonts_beautiful_easily/) to set up fonts for my environment.
