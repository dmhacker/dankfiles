# dankfiles

This directory contains configuration files for my main workstation. I'm running Arch Linux on a Surface Book 2.

Some of the packages are Arch-specific, but there are probably other variants/ways to acquire them if you are using a different distribution.

## Dependencies

* i3-gaps [window manager]
* compton [window compositor]
* polybar [improved status bar]
* nm-applet [WiFi display module]
* rofi [replacement for dmenu]
* redshift [Arch version of flux]
* urxvt [best terminal in the world]
* powerline [fancy terminal prompt]
* powerline-fonts [self-explanatory]
* Vundle [Vim package manager]
